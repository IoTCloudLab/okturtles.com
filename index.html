                        <b>Never pay for an SSL certificate again.</b>
                        Paying a company to generate an SSL certificate for you is madness,
                        especially when you're asked to pay every year and are given
                        a certificate that doesn't do what it's supposed to do: provide
                        your vistors with security.

                        Companies that sell SSL certificates mislead their customers into
                        believing that these certificates protect browser-server communication from all eavesdropping and tampering. As elaborated
                        in <a href="#paper">our paper</a>, this simply isnâ€™t true today.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
