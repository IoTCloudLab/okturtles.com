                        Paying a company to generate an SSL certificate for you is madness,
                        especially when you're asked to pay every year and are given
                        a certificate that <b>doesn't do what it's supposed to do: provide
                            your visitors with security.</b>
                        Companies that sell SSL certificates mislead their customers into
                        believing that these certificates protect browser-server communication from all eavesdropping and tampering. As elaborated
                        in <a href="#paper">our paper</a>, this simply isn’t true today.

                    <p>Google's Certificate Transparency proposal wants certificate authorities (CAs) to "make a note" all of the certificates that they issue into a log somewhere protected in someway and verified via some mechanism. The <a href="other/Original_Proposal_-_Certificate_Transparency.pdf" target="_blank">original proposal</a> is almost this vague. Website owners are then asked to monitor these logs to see if their clients <b>were</b> hacked, in addition to continuing to pay the CAs money for the worthless certificates they provide. We think this proposal makes an excellent case against itself, and we don't find this at all surprising. Companies (like Google) that exploit their customer's information for profit are unlikely to provide meaningful leadership on security because it would hurt their business.</p>
                    <h3 class="h3_sub">DNSSEC</h3>
                    <p><a href="http://www.icann.org/en/about/learning/factsheets/dnssec-qaa-09oct08-en.htm" target="_blank">DNSSEC</a> suggests a complicated mechanism to essentially re-create many of the same problems with X509 and CAs in DNS itself, by providing a chain of trust to untrustworthy entities. Its intended goal is to secure DNS and thereby assure clients that when they ask for apple.com, they are actually visiting apple.com. This proposal <a href="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.general/16353" target="_blank">does not appear to protect against genuine MITM attacks</a>. It also suffers for extreme, unnecessary complexity, which is never a good thing in the design of secure systems. See <a href="http://ianix.com/pub/dnssec-outages.html" target="_blank">this link</a> for additional reasons why DNSSEC is a bad idea in general.</p>
                    <h3 class="h3_sub">Bitmessage</h3>
                    <p><a href="https://bitmessage.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Bitmessage</a> belongs to the same family of software that okTurtles and DNSChain belong to, however it is also very different from them. Bitmessage focuses on providing anonymity to its users first and foremost. For reasons unknown to this author it was not designed to use the Namecoin blockchain, and instead uses its own (though there is nothing preventing integration between the two, and indeed work has <a href="https://bitmessage.org/forum/index.php?topic=2563.0" target="_blank">been done</a> in this area). Bitmessage, however, has a few problems that okTurtles does not have: (1) it does not work over existing websites or protocols (like email) and was not designed with this intention, (2) to quote <a href="other/bitmessage.pdf" target="_blank">the paper</a>: "The difficulty of the proof‐of‐work should be proportional to the size of the message and should be set such that <i>an average computer must expend an average of four minutes of work in order to send a typical message.</i>" (3) It requires constantly running a program in the background (and one that isn't feasible on most mobile devices), and (4) messages take a long time to get to their destination because: "Just like Bitcoin transactions and blocks, all users would receive all messages. They would be responsible for attempting to decode each message with each of their private keys to see whether the message is bound for them."</p>
                    <h3 class="h3_sub">Convergence</h3>
                    <p>In <a href="http://convergence.io/details.html" target="_blank">their words</a>, Convergence "is a secure replacement for the Certificate Authority System. Rather than employing a traditionally hard-coded list of immutable CAs, Convergence allows you to configure a dynamic set of Notaries which use network perspective to validate your communication." In our words: Convergence is similar to having a <i>known_hosts</i> ssh key file for your browser, and comparing it against your friend’s file. It's not a terrible idea, however, the website claims that it’s simple to use, which we have to disagree with because users are asked to manage a list of notaries. It depends on group consensus, but the group might not be very bright. What happens then? It also does not provide MITM protection on first-visit, and all of the notary info appears to be stored locally to the computer, or even the browser. That is rather inconvenient for most users.</p>
                    <h3 class="h3_sub">More to come...</h3>
                    <p>We know this is an incomplete list. Stay tuned for other comparisons.</p>

                            Unfortunately, it's increasingly difficult to tell who the bad guys are. This is a very important question and that's why it's the first one. See <a href="other/dnsnmc_okturtles_overview.pdf" target="_blank">our paper's "Motivation" section</a> for the answer.

                                One significant problem facing Namecoin, Bitcoin, and virtually all other cryptocurrencies, is the so-called <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/bitcoins-fatal-flaw-was-nearly-exposed" target="_blank">"51% problem"</a>.
                                Solutions to the 51% problem exist, but they introduce other problems.

Of course, none of this would be possible if it wasn't for Satoshi Nakamoto's historic <a href="http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> on Bitcoin, and the entire Namecoin <a href="http://dot-bit.org/forum/index.php" target="_blank">community</a>.

                        <h3 class="faq_question" id="nsa_proof" name="nsa_proof">Is this project <i>really</i> "NSA-proof"?</h3>
                        <div class="faq_answer">
                            <p>
                                When we state that okTurtles will "NSA-proof" your online communications, we mean that <b>it will stop all of the publicly known methods by which the NSA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack" target="_blank">can read</a> your messages on these sites.</b>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Specifically, okTurtles will provide true <b>end-to-end encryption</b> and <b>authentication</b> between you and the person you're communicating with that does not fall prey to any of the following:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Coercion of any sort against the host company (e.g. forcing Google or Facebook to hand over their data).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Publicly known attacks against the crypography in use.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Interception, redirection, and/or tampering-with of the communication in question.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Additionally, it is our intention to provide a modicum of <b>plausible deniability</b> features that <i>might</i> protect *you* from coercion (the gun-to-the-head scenario), but they do not guarantee such protection.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It should go without saying that okTurtles <u>will not protect you</u> from any of the following:
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                                <li>Your use of a computer that has been compromised in some other way.</li>
                                <li>The above, but applied to the people you're communicating with.</li>
                                <li>Acts of a diety or some hitherto unknown supra-human intelligence.</li>

                        <p class="faq_answer">
                            Certainly. You can participate directly (see the <a href="https://dot-bit.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1423" target="_blank">Get Involved</a> link at the bottom of the page), or help fund the Kickstarter when it's ready (<a href="#subscribe">subscribe</a> to know when that'll be).

                        <p class="faq_answer">
                            Absolutely not! We have a functioning (though incomplete) version of <a href="https://github.com/okTurtles/dnschain" target="_blank">DNSChain already written</a>. okTurtles is a tad more complicated, and requires a community effort to keep it running smoothly on third-party sites. Most of the design has been explained in <a href="other/dnsnmc_okturtles_overview.pdf" target="_blank">our paper</a>, all that remains is to implement it.
