                        Does adding forward secrecy improve the security of a connection if it has been 
                        hijacked? Not in the slighest. How about "encrypting data center links"?
                        Nope, that do not help even if the connection is secure. A rouge employee, a crafty hacker,
                        or a simple subpoena instantly destroys every shred of security the data has.
                        Do any of these columns help? Not a single one.

                        Even more astonishing is the fact that the EFF appears to be
                        <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptocatapp/status/403302181824385024">ignoring software that

                        gestures of megacorps, without so much as a footnote or disclaimer.

                    <p>
                        Since we appear to have different understandings of what "security" means, we decided
                        to create a modified version of this table that we feel more accurately depicts
                        the security these companies provide, and at the same time acknowledge those
                        who are pioneering <b>meaningful security</b>:

                        The EFF has been around since 1990. Since their founding, they have been one the

                        over the world. They have been a constant source of inspiration to us. In fact, this project
                        probably would not have happened were it not for their fantastic research and reporting
